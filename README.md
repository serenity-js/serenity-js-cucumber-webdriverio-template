## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Create a Project

This repository is a GitHub template. Use it to [create a new GitHub repository](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-repository-from-a-template)
for your project.

If you prefer to work in a virtual environment, you can launch this repository in a [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/from-referrer/) workspace.

### 2. Set Up Your Environment

Install the required tools:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (LTS version 18.12 or later)

- [Java](https://adoptopenjdk.net/) (JRE or JDK version 11 or later)

Follow the [installation guide](https://serenity-js.org/handbook/getting-started/installation/) to verify your setup.

### 3. Install Dependencies

[Clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) the project and run:

```
npm ci
```

This installs dependencies, including the [Serenity BDD CLI](https://serenity-js.org/handbook/reporting/serenity-bdd-reporter/).

### 4. Run Tests

Use the predefined [NPM scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/using-npm/scripts) defined in [`package.json`](package.json) to run your tests
and related tasks:

```
npm test                # Run tests and generate reports
npm start               # Serve test reports at http://localhost:8080

npm run lint            # Run code linter
npm run lint:fix        # Try to automatically fix linting issues
npm run clean           # Remove test reports from any previous test run
```

### 5. Write your tests

Test scenarios are located in the [`./test/specs`](/test/specs) directory.
Modify the examples or write your own scenarios using the [Serenity/JS Screenplay Pattern](https://serenity-js.org/handbook/design/screenplay-pattern/).
